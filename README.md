# faker

Golang Faker module

**Faker** is a go module that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to boostrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production server, Faker is for you.

Faker is heavily inspired by [Python Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) which in turn was inspired by [PHP Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), [Perl Faker](http://search.cpan.org/~jasonk/Data-Faker-0.07/), and [Ruby Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker).
